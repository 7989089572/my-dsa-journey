### 🔹 Types of Data Structures

#### ✅ **Linear Data Structures:**
- **Array**
- **Linked List**
- **Stack**
- **Queue**

#### ✅ **Non-Linear Data Structures:**
- **Tree**
- **Graph**
- **Heap**
- **Trie**

## 🧪 Practice Code (Day 1)

```java
// ArrayBasics.java

public class ArrayBasics {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

        System.out.println("Array elements:");
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            System.out.println("Index " + i + ": " + numbers[i]);
        }
    }
}
